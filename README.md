# Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis

The goal of this first notebook is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering.  In this notebook I will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative

Topics covered: 
    Use Pandas Dataframes to do feature engineering
    Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews
    Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model
    Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review
    Given a classifier, create a confusion matrix
    Compare multiple logistic regression models
