# Amazon Sentiment Analysis

Analysis that implements logistic regression and feature engineering, using 82 million product reviews from original dataset derived from Amazon to perform a binary classification that predicts whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative

Key aspects: 

    - Use Pandas Dataframes to do feature engineering
    - Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews
    - Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model
    - Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review
    - Designing a confusion matrix
    - Compare multiple logistic regression models
